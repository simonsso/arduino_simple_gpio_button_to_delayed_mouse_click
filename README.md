# arduino_simple_gpio_button_to_delayed_mouse_click
A very simple program to trigger a mouse click after as switch circuity closes.

The typical use case when running for instance a flashing rig where a button must be clicked to initiate flashing or testing. This project allows for one mouse click to be automatically generated after the device have been placed in a flashing rig and the its presence is detected.

If the mouse cursor have been carefully placed over the button which is to be clicked, the entire flow can be operated from the rig. 

This have been verified with an Arduino Due board
